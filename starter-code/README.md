##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(I saw it like base was changing the bigger elements, layout was a little more specific with classes and id's, then module were really specific. Module's would call a list item within a list within a div.)

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

(I didn't refactor anything because everything still worked.)
