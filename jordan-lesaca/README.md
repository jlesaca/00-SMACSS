##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I determined what the css was doing and how much it affected. If it affected the overall look, it went into layout, if it affected things like headers and fonts, I put it into base, and if it affected very specific things, I put it into modules.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I didn't see the need to do any refactoring. It seemed like there were classes and ids for very specific things so I didn't want to mess with that.
